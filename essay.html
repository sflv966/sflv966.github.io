    <h1>The Path of The Maker vs The Entrepreneur</h1>

    <p>Why would I want to manage though? Maybe the connection is that an Art Director would know exactly how something should look. Through all his years of experience he knows when an idea is good, when graphics are innovative and compelling.

    Just maybe, that's the point of being an art director and moving up the ladder, as opposed to those burn out designers that complain about bad clients and lack of jobs. Besides, what else do I see myself doing?

    I'm creative and want to exercise my creativity, but not in the world of business. I guesss this is the part that bothers me the most, to deal with analytics and business lingo, specially with my lack to interest for companies.</p>
